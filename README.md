# Solar Plant Monitoring System
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carlosb/solarplant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carlosb/solarplant)

The system consists in obtaining data from "Solar Plants" which produce electricity
and send relevant data, like power consumption, to the cloud. From there, we can
choose to cut the power or detect faulty devices.
