# Overview

This document mainly concerns itself with the installation of the Celeste server on a Ubuntu machine. The installation consists mainly of the following steps:

- Downloading the code
- Compiling
- Installing
- Running the server

It is expected that these steps become easier as the project advances. It is also expected, however, that we have installed some requirements:

- `git`
- `>= clang-3.8`
- `>= cmake-3.0`

We will give a section on how to install these requirements.
